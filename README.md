Executed and thoroughly understood all SQL queries used in the analysis

Modified queries to explore customer frequency, spending patterns, and inactivity

Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Python

Designed and interpreted Power BI dashboards to communicate insights

Developed an understanding of how customer data supports business decisions

Key Business Insights

A relatively small segment of customers contributes significantly to total revenue

Repeat customers exhibit higher average spending compared to one-time buyers

A portion of customers has not made purchases in recent months, indicating potential churn

Targeted offers and loyalty programs can help improve customer retention and lifetime value

Learning Outcomes

Practical application of SQL for customer and sales analysis

Experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Python

Hands-on exposure to dashboard design and data storytelling with Power BI

Improved ability to interpret customer behavior from a business perspective

Outcome

This project strengthened my foundation in data analysis, SQL, and business intelligence and enhanced my ability to analyze customer data and present insights in a structured, professional manner.

Note
